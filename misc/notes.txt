-	avatar upload strategy
	-	how to store images in backend?
-	unique name creation
	-	test if username gets a unique value upon creation 
	-	pop up when user changes a name which already exists

-	match history
	-	check which api endpoint to use

to fix:
	-	POST http://localhost:3000/api/game
		-	crashes in game_stat_service with req body:
			{
			  "player_1": 15,
			  "player_2": 16,
			  "score_player_1": 11,
			  "score_player_2": 6,
			  "type": "classic"
			}
	-	unique name creation
		-	user edit data page reroutes to 404
	-	make a sub component for a Friend button on the user page
	-	UserPage - GameLadder - use navigate to route to
		another user instead of a "Link"
